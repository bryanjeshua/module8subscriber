# Simulation slow subscriber
![](image/rabbitmq3.jpg)
Mine is 1. When I introduced a one-second delay in the subscriber's message processing by uncommenting `thread::sleep(ten_millis);`, it caused the subscriber to consume messages more slowly than they were being published.  The queue size increased to 1 because the publisher continuously sends messages at a faster rate than the subscriber can handle them. However, since the queue size is relatively small, it suggests that the timing of my observations in the RabbitMQ management interface or the frequency of message publication was such that the queue never accumulated more than one message at a time before it was consumed by the subscriber. This results in a consistently low queue size, increasing from zero to one, reflecting the new balance between message publication and the delayed consumption rate.
